# ScatterV
ScatterV is a **custom pipelined RISC-V processor** implemented in SystemVerilog and **synthesized on FPGA**. It features standard functionality of a RISC-V processor and includes a custom instruction, `RND`, which loads a pseudorandom number into a register using a linear feedback shift register (LFSR) to produce maximal-length sequences. Hardware level random number generation sets the foundation for applications such as cryptography, simulations, and randomized algorithms.

This repository builds upon my previous work, [learningVerilog](https://github.com/LeeT27/learningVerilog), where I created a simple, single cycle processor to execute basic ALU, loads, stores, and jumps. ScatterV improves upon this through RISC-V compatibility, new complex instructions, pipelining, and hardware simulation. I seperated the project into three major parts/milestones:
1. Single cycle RISC-V core and RNG implementation
2. Pipeline architecture and hazard mitigation
3. Hardware synthesis and FPGA demo

## Demo Program: Monte Carlo $\pi$ Approximation

To verify correct processor behavior, I implemented a Monte Carlo simulation written entirely in RISC-V assembly. The main star of the show in this simulation is the custom `RND` instruction that constantly creates pseudorandom coordinates.

### Mathematical Principle
The program approximates $\pi$ by generating random coordinate points $(x, y)$ within a square area bounded by (0,0) and (1,1) every tenth of a second and determining the ratio of points that fall inside the shaded quarter circle, calculated using the following circle equation:

$$x^2 + y^2 \le 1$$

<br><br>
An internal "hits" counter is incremented everytime it lands inside the quarter circle and a total "samples counter" is incremented everytime, independent of where it lands. The approximation of π is found through the ratio of points:

$$\pi \approx 4 \times \frac{\text{hits}}{\text{total samples}}$$

The ratio converges to π as the sample size approaches ∞,

## Part 1: Single cycle RISC-V core and RNG implementation
When I finished designing my very [first processor](https://github.com/LeeT27/learningVerilog) around a year ago, I felt very thrilled that I created a custom ISA CPU that could perform simple arithmetic programs. Reflecting, I realized that my ISA was inefficient, slow, and lacking in instructions, thus, I felt more inspired to take on more industry level processors such as RISC-V, while also tackling pipeline theory. I chose RISC-V for its popularity in IoT, embedded systems, and operating systems. Finding that RISC-V is easily modifiable, I also wanted to create a custom instruction, `RND`, could be used for demonstration. Here is the theory behind hardware RNG:

### 🎲 `RND` Instruction Implementation
The core of ScatterV's random number generation comes from the abstract algebra theory of primitive polynomials and its application on a linear feedback shift register (LFSR). To make sequences appear as random as possible every clock cycle, the amount of unique sequences before repeating the same pattern needs to be maximized. This is where the magic of primitive polynomials comes in. A primitive polynomial is a special type of irreducible polynomial, meaning that it cannot be factored into smaller polynomials. Another property is that a primitive polynomial of degree n has $(2^{n}-1)$ unique states before repeating to its old pattern (base will be 2 for digital logic). A good analogy is that if you have a deck of 52 cards, the shuffling mechanism of a primitive polynomial would go through all 52 cards before repeating the pattern rather than a smaller pattern of cycling through the same 8 cards. Here below is an example of a primitive polynomial of degree n = 3: 

### $x^{3} + x + 1$

($2^{3}-1 = 7$ unique states before repeating pattern)

To implement this theory into ScatterV, I used an LFSR to utilize primitive polynomials. An LFSR consists of a chain of flip flops that use the output of an arbitrary amount of chosen flip flops to determine the next incoming bit. The powers of the polynomial $x$ serve as a direct mapping to the register's state. Specifically, each term $x^n$ corresponds to the output of the $n^{th}$ flip-flop within the shift register chain. To maintain the mathematical identity of the primitive polynomial: $x^{3}$+x+1=0, the hardware must keep solving for the constant term. By XORing the $x^{3}$ and x term, we generate the feedback bit 1, thus constantly balancing the equation. All flip flop bits perform a left bitwise shift and the feedback bit is fed into the LSB. Every clock cycle now generates a unique pattern! Here is a diagram I made of the flip flops for n = 3:

<img src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/dcd47c8c-e1f9-4fc6-b67e-e26096d311a7" width="400">

Since RISC-V registers are 32 bits, a primitive polynomial of degree n = 32 will be used to produce 4,294,967,295 unique combinations! 
```systemverilog
//Custom 32-bit Random Number Generator
    logic [31:0] lfsr_reg;
    logic        feedback_bit; //Gets fed into LSB

    // Shift LEFT every cycle, feeding the XOR feedback into the LSB (bit 0)
    always_ff @(posedge clk or posedge rst) begin
        if (rst) begin
            lfsr_reg <= 32'hECEB; // Seed value
        end else begin
            lfsr_reg <= {lfsr_reg[30:0], feedback_bit}; // Drops bit 31, shifts everything left, places feedback in bit 0
        end
    end
```
### Testing #1
Here is a program that performs a simple 1+1=2. Load 1 into x1, 1 into x2, add them together and save into x3. End the program by looping PC to never end.

```systemverilog
initial begin
    mem[0] = 32'h00100093; // addi x1, x0, 1  (x1 = 1)
    mem[1] = 32'h00100113; // addi x2, x0, 1  (x2 = 1)
    mem[2] = 32'h002081B3; // add/ add x3, x1, x2 (rd = 5'b00011)
    mem[3] = 32'h0000006F; // j done (jump to current PC forever)
    for (int i = 4; i < 64; i++) begin
        mem[i] = 32'h00000013; // NOP (addi x0, x0, 0)
    end
end
```

It worked! :) I forgot to append the LSFR signal, but the register is successfully outputting pseudorandom numbers every clock cycle.

### Testing #2
Here is a program that squares a random number between 1 and 10
```systemverilog
initial begin
    mem[0] = 32'h00100093; // addi x1, x0, 1  (x1 = 1)
    mem[1] = 32'h00100113; // addi x2, x0, 1  (x2 = 1)
    mem[2] = 32'h002081B3; // add/ add x3, x1, x2 (rd = 5'b00011)
    mem[3] = 32'h0000006F; // j done (jump to current PC forever)
    for (int i = 4; i < 64; i++) begin
        mem[i] = 32'h00000013; // NOP (addi x0, x0, 0)
    end
end
```

### Part 1 Reflection
When designing ScatterV, I didn't realize how big of a jump going from my old CPU to RISC-V was. The new instruction types such as branching, upper intermediates, and new jumps quickly felt overwhelming. Figuring out the new multiplexers for control signals and operands was frustrating. Specifically, it was difficult designing wb_sel and pc_sel since the upper intermediate (AUIPC/LUI) and subroutine call instructions (JAL) demanded more signals to satisfy their cases. Another frustrating moment was how only two R-type instructions require func7[5] to be 1, which are SUB and SRA, in which I had to disable func7 when it's not an R-type instruction. For example, if I didn't disable func7 for I-type, using ADDI where bit 30 is 1 would cause unintentional subtraction when I meant to use the immediate range with bit 30 in it. One more frustrating challenge in this part was adding half word and single byte load/store instructions because of having to manage offsets if the memory address isn't a factor of 4, since the RAM is an array of words, not bytes. One thing that definitely helped overall was working on the top module and control unit first as they gave me better visualization of how the signals should interact in the leftover modules. Constantly testing module functionality in EDAPlayground also allowed me to deduct bugs.

## Part 2: Pipeline architecture and hazard mitigation
This portion of the project is about converting my functional single cycle RISC-V core into a pipelined core in order to increase the maximum clock speed. A major issue with my first processor a year back was not only that it was a single cycle, where each instruction needed to complete the 5 stages before the next instruction, but also that heavy instructions such as `MULT` and `DIV` made the worst case propogation delay much longer. I pipelined scatterV to minimize the worst propogation delay using the following pipeline system:
